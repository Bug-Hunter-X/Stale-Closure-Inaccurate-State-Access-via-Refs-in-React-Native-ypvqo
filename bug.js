In React Native, using a ref to access a component's state directly can lead to unexpected behavior.  This is because refs provide direct access to the DOM element or component instance, but not necessarily the updated state. State updates are asynchronous, and reading the state immediately after a state change might not reflect the latest value. For example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(myRef.current.state.count); // Might log the old value!
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
      <MyOtherComponent ref={myRef} count={count} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

`MyOtherComponent` might not have its state updated yet.
